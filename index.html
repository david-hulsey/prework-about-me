      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a General Manager for Snooze and father of 2 opinionated boys.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Del Rio, Texas</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am an avid player of video games.  My two favorite are currently, WoW and Clash Royale.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Honestly, running my own sports podcast or being a sport broadcaster. I was not gifted with the natural ability or dedication necessary to make it as a professionial athlete but, man do I have a lot of opinions.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I live in Richmond, Texas.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I watched older people struggle with technology while I was growing up. I promised myself that I would always be in the know. I spend a lot of time on my computer anyway so I figured that I would put that time to a more productive use.</p>
